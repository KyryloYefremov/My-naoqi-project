# NAOqi3

This project introduces a **NAOqi3** - Python 3-compatible wrapper for the NAOqi SDK, originally available only in Python 2. With this bridge, you can write code that communicates with NAO robots in Python 3, using the same syntax as NAOqi's original Python 2 library.

This interface will work with the current library to ensure full functionality of this library with modern versions of Python.

**The main goal of developing this interface is to be able to use the NAOqi library with modern tools** - image processing libraries, AI and ML tools etc. that are in Python version 3 and above.

## Technical Details
This project consists of two components:
- **NAOqi3** (code in this repo),
- **NAOqi SDK** (original library that must be installed separately).

The whole project is written in Python 3.11.0 and primarly designed for NAOqi SDK version 2.1.4 (for NAO robots versions 4 and 5).

## Installation guide
**STEPS:**
1. [Python 3.11.0 installation](#step-1-install-python-3-if-not-installed) (or any other versions you would like)
2. [Python 2.7.18 installation](#step-2-install-python-2718-required) (required for NAOqi SDK)
3. [NAOqi SDK instalation](#step-3-install-naoqi-sdk-214-and-add-it-to-python-global-dependencies-required)
4. [Setup first project and install NAOqi3](#step-4-setup-first-project-and-install-naoqi3-required) (TODO: improve this section)

### Step 1: Install Python 3 (if not installed)
_This step is required if you don't have Python 3 installed on your system. If you already have Python 3, you can skip this step._

1. Go to [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) to download Python 3.11.0.
2. Scroll to the very end of the page and you will see different installers.
3. Select installer based on your PC system architecture:
   - Windows installer (64-bit) if you have 64-bit system architecture
   - Windows installer (32-bit) if you have 32-bit system architecture

   - In this tutorial the 64-bit version will be selected.
4. Click on it to start downloading.
5. After the installation is complete, open the installed file. You should see similar to this window:  
![00_install_python3110](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b19cb1f6-7f38-4c38-9593-5c4c9fec6590)

**You have successfully installed Python 2.7.18 on your computer!**

### Step 3: install NAOqi SDK 2.1.4 and add it to Python global dependencies (required)
1. Firstlly, install NAOqi SDK from this repository by clicking on this link [pynaoqi.rar](pynaoqi.rar) and clicking on an install icon. <br>
<img width="1096" alt="install_rar" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04311ba5-5ec0-421d-80df-892bb33b058a" />  <br>
2. After the installation is complete, extract the archive. After the extraction you should see a folder `üìÅ pynaoqi`.
3. Then copy entire folder `pynaoqi` and place it in folder with the path: `C:\Program Files\Python27\Lib\site-packages`.
4. Next click "Win" button on your keyboard and type "Edit the system environment variables". Then click "Enter".
5. You should see this window opened:  <br>
<img alt="01_install_naoqisdk" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e94c685-60bc-4608-a2a1-9fbc92e2cd37" />  <br>
6. Then click on "Environment variables": <br>
<img alt="02_install_naoqisdk" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd52181d-f165-407f-941c-9a0b18f1be9e" />  <br>
7. Click on "New": <br>
<img alt="03_install_naoqisdk" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bde41f2-e9a5-4677-a6f3-d0eba2535f1f" />  <br>
8. Create new variable with name `PYTHONPATH` and value `your-path-to-python27\Lib\site-packages\pynaoqi\lib` and click "Ok": <br>
<img alt="04_install_naoqisdk" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10829a62-0cf5-4a16-82a6-39a6b425a835" />  <br>
9. Check if new variable was successfully added and click "Ok".  <br>
<img alt="05_install_naoqisdk" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a07adbf-c9ea-4d42-977a-dd695da4cd70" />  <br>
10. Exit by clicking on "Ok".  <br>
<img alt="06_install_naoqisdk" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8caa170-b60c-4ed5-8211-fdf3dbdcace5" />  <br>

**You have successfully installed and added NAOqi SDK to your Python 2.7.18 environment!**

### Step 4: Setup first project and install NAOqi3 (required)
_For this part you need to have a git system installed on your computer._ <br>
_Also you need to have a Python IDE installed on your computer (for example PyCharm)._ <br>

This part will describe how to create new project in PyCharm, clone NAOqi3 from this repository and setup all required settings.

1. Create a new PyCharm project.
2. Open ternimal and clone the NAOqi3 from this repository: `git clone https://github.com/KyryloYefremov/My-naoqi-project`.
3. Navigate to `.\My-naoqi-project\server` folder, then create a new virtual environment with Python 2.7.18 and activate it.
4. Open another terminal window, navigate to `.\My-naoqi-project\client` folder, then create a new virtual environment with Python 3.11.0 and activate it.
5. Then you will be having two terminals: one opened at `.\My-naoqi-project\server` folder with activated virtual env. for Python 2 and second opened at `.\My-naoqi-project\client` folder with activated virtual env. for Python 3.
6. To try to run a Python 3 program on NAOqi3, navigate to `.\My-naoqi-project\client\config.py` and uncommit or create NAO IP address and NAO port.
7. Then run `naoqi_server.py` in Python 2 terminal running this command: `python naiqi_server.py`.
8. After this you can try to run any Python 3 test example from folder `client\examples`. Try to run in Python 3 terminal for example: `python .\examples\core\test_say_hello.py`.

**‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è Important information ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è**

After successfully installing and launching NAOqi3, you can remove all `examples\` folders (both in `server\` and `client\`) or leave it for inspiration. All files you actually require are: `client\naoqi_client.py`, `client\fetch_naoqi_constants.py`, `client\config.py` (to have NAO configs stored), `client\naoqi3.py`, `server\naoqi_server.py`, `server\proxy_service.py`.

## FAQ
**_I have already installed Python 3.9, will NAOqi3 work with this version?_** <br>
Yes, the NAOqi3 will work on any Python 3 version, but if you want to use existing examples from this repository (for example `final-program\`), consider using the same Python version (3.11.0) that was used for developing this program. <br>

**_I don't have a git system installed, what should I do?_** <br>
If you don't have a git system installed on your PC, follow this [official webpage tutorial](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), find a section "Install git on Windows" and follow all its steps.
